                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A twenty year veteran of public libraries and public schools, my number one signature strength is a love of learning.  While pursuing a PhD in English education from The University of Georgia, I developed a love for philosophy.  One of my goals I hope to achieve with my newly acquired coding skills is to create a philosphy-based self-help app to help people survive the unique challenges of modernity.  I have a strong work ethic, and I am known by my colleagues as someone eager to analyze and synthesize data to help better steer our objectives.  I am very motivated by practical matters and real-world results, and I gain a great deal of satisfaction on working behind the scenes doing the job that needs to be done.  In my spare time I enjoy refinishing furniture, reading, hiking, and gardening. I have a wonderful husband and three very smart cats. Fun fact: We recently bought a 1960's home located on the "Space Coast" of Florida, and as part renovations I built and tiled both showers from the ground up.     </p>
